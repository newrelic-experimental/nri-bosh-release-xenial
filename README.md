# NRI BOSH Release - Xenial

> A bosh release for deploying the New Relic Infrastructure agent to CLoud Foundry

This is a self contained bosh release for installing the New Relic Infrastructure agent on Cloud Foundry. It includes the [.deb] package as a blob and has an install script that installs the package. It is a standard BOSH install package for Ubuntu Xenial.

The release is meant to be installed as an addon. In order to facilitate that, a sample runtime.yml file is included with properties required for the installation procedure.


## Installation

### Upload the release

To use, upload the release:
```bash
bosh upload-release ~/Downloads/nr-bosh-release-xenial-1.20.7.tgz
```

### Update runtime config

In the sample runtime.yml file in the base directory of the repo, set the `license_key` parameter to the target New Relic account's license key to which you'd like infrastructure agents to report. 

If there are other values that you wish to modify (e.g. agent properties, custom attributes) you could make those changes here.

...and then, use the following bosh command to update the runtime config:
```bash
bosh update-runtime-config runtime.yml
```

### Deploy to Cloud Foundry

Finally, use <strong>`"bosh deploy"`</strong> command to redeploy the release.
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> bosh deploy command arguments vary. Please refer to BOSH documentation for [bosh deploy](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#deploy) command options for your CF foundation.




## Usage
- Login to [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com) 
- From the top menu bar select <strong>"Infrastructure"</strong> 
- View all infrastructure agents reporting to your New Relic account
- Refer to New Relic documentation for [Infrastructure UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities/)
- You could filter by tags and all other properties to view only the nodes that are reporting from Cloud Foundry Foundation


## Build & Release

### Prerequisites
- make sure `git cli` is installed on your system
- make sure `bosh cli` is installed and configured on your system to target [bosh director](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs-openssl/#target)

### Build the release
- clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nri-bosh-release-xenial.git
```

- change directory to the local repo you just cloned
```bash
cd nri-bosh-release-xenial
```

- run the following command to capture the previous infrastructure agent file name and version
```bash
bosh blobs
```

- remove the existing infrastructure agent binary from the blob
```bash
bosh remove-blob <PREVIOUS_INFRASTRUCTURE_BLOB_PATH>
```

- download the latest <strong>"amd"</strong> build for Infrastructure agent (e.g. `newrelic-infra_systemd_1.20.7_amd64.deb`)
```bash
wget -q https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/apt/pool/main/n/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra_systemd_${new_agent_version}_amd64.deb
```

- add the newly downloaded infrastructure agent to the blobsstore
	</br><br/>
	<strong>Note:</strong> the file name that is added to the blobstore has a shorter name than the one you downloaded
```bash
bosh add-blob newrelic-infra_systemd_<NEW_VERSION>_amd64.deb newrelic-infra_<NEW_VERSION>_amd64.deb
```

- edit the following files and update the infrastructure agent version to the new version you downloaded
```
	jobs/install-nri/templates/nri.sh
	packages/nr-infra/packaging
	packages/nr-infra/spec
```

- make sure the <strong>version</strong> property in runtime.yml matches the release version you're creating

- run the following command to build the release package
```bash
bosh create-release --version=<NEW_VERSION> --tarball=release/nri-bosh-release-xenial-<NEW_VERSION>.tgz --[force | final]
```
